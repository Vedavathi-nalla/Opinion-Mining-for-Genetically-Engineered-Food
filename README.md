# Opinion-Mining-for-Genetically-Engineered-Food

Public opinions and attitudes towards GM food are highly polarized, making it challenging for policymakers and industry stakeholders to make informed decisions. Opinion mining, a  subfield of natural language processing, has been increasingly employed to analyze large amounts of textual data and extract people's opinions and sentiments. This project presents a comprehensive review of existing literature on opinion mining for GM food. The paper discusses the different approaches to opinion mining, including lexicon-based, NLP models and knowledge graphs and their applications in analyzing textual data related to GM food. This project also explores the challenges and limitations of opinion mining for GM food, such as the lack of standardized lexicons and the difficulty in capturing sarcasm and irony in text. Lastly, the project discusses the potential implications of opinion mining for GM food, such as its role in informing public policies and shaping public opinion. The project also discusses another approach to analyzing networks : in a way of using information extraction and open-source knowledge bases. The findings of this paper provide valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders interested in understanding public opinion and attitudes towards GM food.
Genetically modified crops (GM crops), also known as genetically modified crops or genetically engineered crops, are plants that have been genetically changed through  biotechnology to have certain desirable properties. Resistance to pests, illnesses, or environmental conditions, greater nutritional content, and increased production potential are examples of such features. GM crops are generated by adding genes from other species into the plant's DNA, resulting in genetic changes that do not occur naturally.

We collected all tweets containing the search string: GMCrops. Along with the tweet text, we downloaded the date and time when the tweet was published, and the location of the user (if provided). We also downloaded the user id, follower ids, and friends’ ids. The followers of a user A are those users who will receive messages from user A. The friends of a user A are those users from whom user A receives messages. Thus, information flows from a user to his followers. We collected tweets using the open source information tool,TWINT.(https://github.com/twintproject) and a python algorithm. Another library called snscrape, was used to collect data using the keyword ‘GM crops’, ‘genetic food’ etc, and we have a dataset of 10001 rows and 4 columns.

When dealing with numerical data, data cleaning often involves removing null values and duplicate data, dealing with outliers, etc. With text data, there are some common data cleaning techniques, which are also known as text pre-processing techniques. With text data, this cleaning process can go on forever. There's always an exception to every cleaning step. So, we're going to follow the MVP (minimum viable product) approach - start simple and iterate. Here are a bunch of things you can do to clean your data. We're going to execute just the common cleaning steps here and the rest can be done at a later point to improve our results.

The pre-trained lexicon-based sentiment analysis tool VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is frequently used for sentiment analysis tasks in NLP. It was created primarily for social media text analysis, and it works especially well with brief and informal texts like tweets and online reviews.

Topic Modeling (TM) is the process of extracting information from textual materials (information retrieval in English) and presenting it in the form of topics (depending on the technique used, the relative importance of the themes can also be found).

LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) is a topic modelling approach that is commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) to find topics or themes in a collection of documents. It is an unsupervised learning technique that assumes each text is a mix of a few issues and that each word in the document is attributed to one of the topics. LDA describes documents as topic mixes that spew out words with varying probability.

The frequency distribution of word counts in tweets may give vital insights into tweet length or size and assist in analysing language use trends in tweets, which can be beneficial in a variety of applications such as sentiment analysis, topic modelling, and social media analytics.

Though we’ve already seen what are the topic keywords in each topic, a word cloud with the size of the words proportional to the weight is a pleasant sight. The colouring of the topics we’ve taken here is followed in the subsequent plots as well.

A word cloud is a visual representation of text data in which words are shown in various sizes, with the size of each word signifying its frequency or importance in the text. Generating a word cloud of the top N terms in each subject is a typical approach used in topic modelling to graphically display the most frequent or essential words related with each topic.

A topic-colored sentence chart can offer a visual summary of the topic distribution within a text corpus, making it simpler to discover patterns, trends, and links between subjects. It may be a useful tool for assessing and understanding topic modelling analysis results, as well as presenting the findings to others in a clear and intuitive manner. This analysis can provide insights into the prevalence or prominence of different topics in the text data and help in understanding the overall topic distribution and patterns within the corpus.

A t-SNE clustering chart may be an effective tool for analysing and visualising high-dimensional data in a reduced-dimensional environment, and it can give information about the linkages and clustering patterns of the data points. It may be used to better comprehend the data and enable decision-making in a variety of domains, including data analysis, machine learning, and pattern recognition.
